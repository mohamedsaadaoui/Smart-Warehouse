Smart Warehouse is a full-stack warehouse and inventory management platform that replaces manual (spreadsheet) stock tracking with a real-time system: multi-warehouse stock movements, low-stock alerts, multi-supplier management, and an analytics dashboard — secured with JWT and role-based access control.

## Tech Stack

### Backend

| Layer | Technology |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 3.5 |
| Security | Spring Security + JWT (RBAC: `ADMIN` / `MANAGER` / `EMPLOYEE`) |
| Persistence | Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL |
| Real-time | WebSocket / STOMP |
| Mapping | MapStruct, Lombok |
| Validation | Spring Boot Validation |
| API docs | SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI) |
| Tests | JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers, JaCoCo coverage |

### Frontend

- React 19, Vite 6, TypeScript 5.7 (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 + shadcn/ui-style components
- TanStack Query (React Query) v5 for server state management
- Material UI (MUI 6) + Headless UI primitives
- React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- STOMP (via `@stomp/stompjs`) + SockJS for real-time notifications
- Recharts for analytics, React Router v7 with protected/admin routes
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- PDF Export: jsPDF + jsPDF-AutoTable

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization** — register/login with JWT; roles `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `EMPLOYEE`
- **Product & Category management** — CRUD, stock status, low-stock detection
- **Multi-warehouse inventory** — stock entries, exits and inter-site movements with `MovementType`
- **Suppliers** — multi-supplier management
- **Dashboard** — counts by status/category, low-stock list, recent movements, monthly stats
- **Advanced Reports** — interactive charts (bar, line, pie), supplier performance, PDF export with jsPDF
- **Notifications** — in-app notifications pushed in real time via WebSocket (including user-to-user)
- **Audit log** — records create/update/delete/login/register actions (ADMIN)
- **User management** — admin-only user CRUD with role assignment
- **Settings** — configurable application settings (ADMIN)
- **Type-safe API layer** — Axios interceptors with JWT injection, Zod schema validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 21
- Node.js 20+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### 1. Start the database

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts PostgreSQL 17 with health checks and initialization scripts.

### 2. Run the backend

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:8080` (Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

### Full Stack with Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (database data)
docker compose down -v
```

Services:
- **PostgreSQL**: `localhost:5432`
- **Backend API**: `localhost:8080`
- **Frontend**: `localhost:5173`

Environment variables (create `.env` file):
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-min-32-chars
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=SecurePassword123
```

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend starts on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite) and proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend.

### Development Commands (Frontend)

```bash
cd frontend

# Development
npm run dev           # Start Vite dev server
npm run build         # Type check + production build
npm run preview       # Preview production build

# Testing
npm run test          # Watch mode
npm run test:run      # Single run with coverage
npm run test:ui       # Visual test UI

# Code Quality
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format        # Prettier
```

On first startup, `DataInitializer` seeds the `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` and `EMPLOYEE` roles.

## API Overview

| `/api/reports/inventory/pdf` | GET | PDF export of inventory report |
| `/api/reports/movements` | GET | Stock movement analytics with date filtering |
| `/api/reports/products` | GET | Product performance report |

All report endpoints support optional `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters (ISO 8601 format).

## Testing

### Backend

The backend follows a testing pyramid:

- **Unit tests** — services with mocked repositories (JUnit 5 + Mockito)
- **Integration tests** — real PostgreSQL via **Testcontainers**, exercising JWT-secured API flows

Run the full suite with coverage:

```bash
./mvnw verify
```

Coverage is enforced with **JaCoCo** (≥70% instruction coverage gate) and the report is generated at `target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

### Frontend

- **Unit tests** — Vitest + React Testing Library
- **E2E tests** — Playwright (to be configured)
- **Type checking** — TypeScript strict mode (`tsc --noEmit`)
- **Linting** — ESLint with React hooks rules

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:run    # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint        # Lint check
```

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main`:

### Backend
- `mvnw verify` — tests + Testcontainers + JaCoCo coverage gate (≥70%)
- Codecov upload for coverage tracking

### Frontend
- ESLint + TypeScript strict type checking
- Vitest unit tests with coverage
- Production build (`npm run build`)

### Security
- Trivy filesystem vulnerability scan
- SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab

### Docker
- Multi-stage builds for backend (Maven → JRE Alpine) and frontend (Node → Nginx Alpine)
- Non-root user execution
- Build & push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) with BuildKit caching
- Separate images for backend and frontend

### Deployment
- Staging deployment on merge to `main` (manual approval via environment)

## Recent Improvements (v0.2.0)

### Frontend Enhancements
- **Component Library**: Added shadcn/ui-style components with Tailwind CSS (Button, Card, Input, Table, Badge, Skeleton)
- **State Management**: Integrated TanStack Query (React Query) v5 for server state with caching, retries, and deduplication
- **TypeScript Strictness**: Enabled strict mode with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`
- **Path Aliases**: Configured `@/` imports for cleaner imports
- **Testing Setup**: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom with coverage reporting
- **Toast Notifications**: react-hot-toast for user feedback
- **Utility Functions**: `cn()` helper (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional class names

### Docker & Infrastructure
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized backend (Maven → JRE Alpine) and frontend (Node → Nginx Alpine) images
- **Security Hardening**: Non-root users, minimal base images, health checks
- **Resource Limits**: Memory limits and reservations for all containers
- **Database Initialization**: PostgreSQL extensions (uuid-ossp, pg_trgm, btree_gin) via init scripts
- **Network Isolation**: Dedicated Docker network

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Parallel Jobs**: Backend, Frontend, Security scans run in parallel
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanner with SARIF upload to GitHub Security
- **Separate Docker Images**: Backend and frontend images pushed independently to GHCR
- **BuildKit Caching**: GitHub Actions cache for faster builds
- **Staging Deployment**: Environment-based deployment with manual approval

### New Feature: Advanced Reports
- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts (products by category, inventory value), Line chart (stock movements), Pie chart (top products)
- **Supplier Performance Table**: Sortable table with product counts and total values
- **PDF Export**: One-click PDF generation with jsPDF + jsPDF-AutoTable
- **Date Range Filtering**: Dynamic date range picker for report period selection
- **Real-time Data**: Powered by TanStack Query with automatic refetching
